     * Repeatedly checks a boolean condition with an exponential backoff strategy

     * @param {Function} boolFunc - An async function that returns a boolean
     * @param {number} [max=5] - Maximum number of attempts to check the condition
     * @returns {Promise<boolean>} 
     * - Returns true if the condition becomes true within the max attempts
     * - Returns false if the condition remains false after max attempts
     * 
     * @description
     * This method implements a retry mechanism with the following characteristics:
     * - Checks the condition every 1.5 seconds
     * - Increases wait time between attempts exponentially
     * - Stops and returns true as soon as the condition becomes true
     * - Stops and returns false if max attempts are reached
